                <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>The Goal: </b>Sweden to reach net zero greenhouse emissions by 2045</p>
                <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>The Task: </b>Design a clean and sustainable wind turnbine blade for use in a wind farm</p>
                <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>The Constraints: </b>8.5mm < Blade deflection < 10mm </p>
                <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>The Solution: </b>Maximize blade efficiency while being eco-friendly</p>
                <h3 class="p-proj-heading-rest">Skills Used</h3>
                <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>Soft Skills: </b>Collaboration, Engineering Report Writing, Time Management</p>
                <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>Technical Skills: </b>Autodesk Inventor, ANSYS-GRANTA EduPack, Microsoft Office</p>
                <h3 class="p-proj-heading-rest">Design Process</h3>
                <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>Initial Research: </b>The team gathered information about wind turbine blade design and shared the knowledge 
                amongst each other</p>
                <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>Problem Framing: </b>The team met several times to properly define the problem, then came up with the 
                objective, function, and constraints of our blade design</p>
                <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>MPI Selection: </b>The team chose the two main objectives to be minimizing energy required to manufacture 
                the blade and minimizing CO2 production</p>
                <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>Materials Selection: </b>The team took the most common materials that showed up for each MPI then used a 
                weighted decision matrix to choose our final material</p>
                <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>Deflection Simulation: </b>The team ran deflection simulations on various thicknesses of the blade 
                to find allow maximum deflection of the blade</p>
                <h3 class="p-proj-heading-rest">Administrative Role</h3>
                <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>Role: </b>I was the Subject Matter Expert</p>
                <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>Responsibilities: </b>I created and shared the collaborative working document for the team and completed the 
                Source Materials Database</p>
                <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>Expectations: </b>Ensured that the team worked on the Project Report in a collaborative manner and that the 
                sources used in the project are broad and reliable</p>
                <h3 class="p-proj-heading-rest">What I learned</h3>
                <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>Collaboration: </b>I learned how to complete engineering projects as a team. I also learned that having 
                multiple people helped getting ideas on the table faster.</p>
                <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>Time management: </b>Since Design Studio times were limited and always had milestones to complete, I 
                learned how to more efficiently get things done.</p>
                <h3 class="p-proj-heading-rest">Final Thoughts</h3>
                <p class="p-proj-desc">Given that this was the first ever engineering project anyone in the entire team had really undertaken, 
                all things went very smoothly. I think we all learned something about how to work better in a team and how to approach engineering 
                projects in general.
