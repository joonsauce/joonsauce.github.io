            <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>The Constraints: </b>Mechanism must be constrained to specific locations on hopper, 
            Q-Bot must operate within a given area</p>

            <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>Problem Framing: </b>The team met several times to accurately define the problem, then came up with the 
            objective, function, and constraints of our solution</p>
            <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>Initial Research: </b>The modeling team researched about different lifting/tilting mechanisms while the 
            computing team gathered information about the Q-Bot and line-tracking algorithms</p>
            <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>Initial Prototype: </b>Each member of the modeling sub-team created multiple designs for the 
            two different actuators</p>
            <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>Choosing the design: </b>The modeling sub-team used a weighted decision matrix to choose 
            the design direction in terms of creativity, viability, and cost - according to the matrix, the hydraulic-powered 
            mechanism was the best option for the team</p>
            <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>Planning: </b>The modeling sub-team split up the work into small parts that each team member can 
            work on at their own pace</p>
            <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>Materials selection: </b>After each part was designed, the team decided which parts should be 3D printed 
            using PLA filament and which parts should be laser cut on a acryllic sheet of plastic</p>
            <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>Fitting: </b>The modeling sub-team checked if the parts would be mounted correctly on the baseplate as per 
            the CAD model and checked if the mechanism functioned as intended.</p>
            <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>Testing: </b>The team tested if the software from the computing sub-team is compatible with the modeling 
            sub-team's design</p>

            a Source Materials Database at the end of the project.</p>

                uses both the hardware and software extensively.</p>

            <p class="p-proj-desc">I found that since our team decided to think outside the box and try something new, it added to the challenge 
            of creating an engineering solution to a problem. Because our approach was not traditional and the TAs/IAIs had little experience with 
            what we wanted to create, I felt that we may have had a slight disadvantage. However, by forging our own path, I found that we learned 
            how to create something completely new with minimal help.</p>
