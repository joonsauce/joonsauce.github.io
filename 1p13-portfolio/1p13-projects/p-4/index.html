            <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>Initial Research: </b>The team gathered initial information about the scope of the client's medical 
            problems</p>
            <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>Problem Framing: </b>The team met several times to accurately define the problem, then came up with the 
            objective, function, and constraints of our solution</p>
            <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>Initial Prototype: </b>The team of four split into a computing and modeling sub-team to create basic 
            hardware and software prototypes to get started</p>
            <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>Planning: </b>Each sub-team came up with a timeline on completion of smaller parts of the project; 
            the computing sub-team came up with a flowchart for the machine learning backend and the embedded software while the modeling 
            sub-team came up with a to-do list of small parts they needed to create.</p>
            <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>Development: </b>The computing sub-team split into a machine learning and embedded sub-team to 
            develop each software separately</p>
            <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>Code Review: </b>The computing sub-team converged together multiple times to make sure small parts 
            of each other's work was functioning as intended and would be compatible with each other's code</p>
            <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>Testing: </b>I tested my code (embedded software of ESP32-CAM) with the electrical components to 
            ensure the code sends images correctly over a Bluetooth connection. I also tested the front-end (web app) and back-end 
            (API server) of WIFOM to make sure it correctly processes the images from the ESP32-CAM.</p>
            <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>Fitting: </b>I met with the modeling team multiple times to make sure the electrical components would 
            fit well within the glasses. We also tested if the housing of the glasses would affect the line of sight of the camera.</p>

            <h3 class="p-proj-heading-rest"><u>What I learned</u></h3>
            <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>Inter-team collaboration: </b>I learned how to create software while collaborating with different sub-teams, 
            including making sure the camera could communicate with the machine learning backend, and making sure the electrical components would 
            function as intended when closed inside the glasses.</p>
            <p class="p-proj-desc"><b>Time management: </b>Since Project 4 was more open-ended than the previous projects, it was a lot hader to 
            get a sense of when every little task should be finished by. I learned how to use to-do lists and calendars more effectively to 
            manage my time better, not only for the project but for other courses as well.</p>

            <h3 class="p-proj-heading-rest"><u>Final Thoughts</u></h3>
                <p class="p-proj-desc">Given the complexity of the solution in such a short amount of time, I think the project went quite 
                smoothly. All members of the team came out of the project with learning something new technical, and with a better sense of 
                time management to get the project under wraps faster.</p>
